Question Bank User Manual
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
--------------------
This piece of software was created as a group project for the authors' Intro To Software Design
course. As such, it is fairly simple in its design and uses. This project serves as a digital bank
that allows the creation, editing, deletion, and tagging of questions, that can be saved and loaded
to/from a JSON file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended Usage
--------------------
This question bank can be used as a means of creating and tagging questions, that are then saved to
a file in JSON format. The saved bank is in a universally standard format, so it can be used for a
variety of applications, such as loading into a question taking system
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Notes About the Question Bank
--------------------
As of the current release, this bank does not automatically save its state and must be manually
saved or all added questions and tags with be lost. There is also no confirmation when deleting
questions, tags, or the whole bank. Please use caution with these functions. There is no 'undo'
function, so ensure an action is wanted, before completing said action. There is button labeled
"Cancel" on all screens that will discard all changes and take you back to the previous screen.
Pressing 'X' in the top-right corner of any screen will discard all changes and take you back to
the main screen.
